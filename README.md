    If you use/adapt our code in your work (either as a stand-alone tool or as a component of any algorithm), please cite our paper. 

    This code is for academic purpose only. Not for commercial/industrial activities.

NOTE:

This Matlab version is a re-implementation with HSID-CNN(In peer-review), and is for the ease of understanding the algorithm. This code is not optimized, and the speed is not representative. The result can be slightly different from the paper due to transferring across platforms.

Enviroment:

     Window 7, Cuda 7.5, Caffe framework (**Necessary, GPU mode better**), Matlab R2014b. 
     Place set this folder into "($Caffe_Dir)/examples/"
